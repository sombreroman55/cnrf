# nrfutil-c

nrfutil-c is a C port of the pc-nrfutil Python package written and maintained by Nordic Semiconductor.
The hope of this port is that it is able to be run on microcontrollers and embedded systems where Python
is either not an option or not fast enough.

## Introduction

This application will hopefully support the same features as the Python package.
Those features are:

* Device Firmware Update (DFU) package generation
* Cryptographic key generation, management and storage
* Bootloader DFU setting generation and display
* DFU procedure over serial/USB
* DFU procedure over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
* DFU procedure over Thread
